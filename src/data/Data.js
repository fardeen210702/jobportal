Over two million people stay on Airbnb every night and the Trust\n\nEngineering team keeps our hosts and guests safe and supported throughout the entire Airbnb\n\nexperience.\n\nAs part of the Trust Engineering team you will be in charge of designing and building scalable\n\nand robust systems to detect and mitigate fraud across our entire platform. You will be deeply\n\ninvolved in the technical details of building highly available and real-time risk detection services\n\nin close collaboration with product, data science and operations teams to understand ever\n\nevolving attack vectors and to keep Airbnb a safe and trusted community.\n\nThere are still many unsolved problems to tackle in both online and offline risk, and we're\n\nlooking for talented engineers to solve these challenges with us.\n\nWhat is a Full Stack Engineer on Trust at Airbnb?\n\nMillions of users engage with Airbnb every day. As a Full Stack Engineer on Trust, your mission\n\nis to build products and services that create trust and safety for all Airbnb users. You are critical\n\nto detecting and preventing fraud, as well as protecting users on the platform. We are looking for\n\nengineers to tackle projects with large scope, drive significant business impact, and be technical\n\nstewards of our services.\n\nWe’re looking for product-aware engineers who are thoughtful, creative, and passionate about\n\nbuilding the best possible systems and user experiences. We’re looking for someone who is not\n\nonly well-versed in backend development, but also has strong product sensibilities and enjoys\n\nworking closely with world class product managers, designers and data scientists.\n\nProjects:\n\nAirbnb was originally built on a ruby on rails monolithic architecture. This architecture has been\n\ndeprecated, however, our team still has several products built on the old stack. We need to\n\nmigrate these products to Airbnb’s modern service oriented architecture. These products\n\ninclude:\n\n● Message spam education\n\n○ When a user receives a suspicious message, we show them a popup indicating\n\nthat they should be careful with this message. This helps stop phishing attacks\n\nand scams.\n\n○ This system needs to be migrated off the monolithic architecture to a new service\n\nwith proper testing and monitoring.\n\n● Child Exploitation Imagery\n\n○ Our service detects child exploitation images and immediately removes them\n\nfrom the platform and bans the user from our site.\n\n○ This system needs to be migrated to our modern architecture and also needs\n\nperformance improvements.\n\n● Queues\n\n○ Many of our mitigation solutions involve agents manually reviewing content and\n\nmaking decisions on next steps (such as banning users, removing listings, or\n\nsending educational emails).\n\n○ Several of these queues need to be migrated which are critical in responding\n\nquickly to several different kinds of fraud and scams\n\n● Lead or assist with other migrations and fraud projects\n\nExpectations and Responsibilities\n\n● Participate in all aspects of agile software development including design,\n\nimplementation, testing and deployment\n\n● Build and maintain Java based microservices having well defined APIs that are highly\n\nreliable and scalable\n\n● Architect and implement solutions to improve reliability, observability, efficiency and\n\nperformance of existing systems\n\n● Troubleshoot, debug and maintain existing systems\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\n● 5+ years industry experience, or equivalent\n\n● Bachelor’s and/or Master’s degree, preferably in CS, or equivalent experience\n\n● Experience developing in Java and familiarity with it’s unit testing frameworks\n\n● Experience working with large-scale software systems\n\n● Demonstrated knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals\n\n● Excellent debugging and optimization skills, and a focus for building reliable systems\n\n● Strong communication skills, eagerness to learn and to collaborate with the engineering\n\nteam\n\n● Experience in Ruby is a plus, but not a requirement\n\n● Experience in fraud, payments, or other Trust-related systems is a plus, but not a\n\nrequirement\n\nSkills:\n\nJava, Microservices, Api, ruby on rails, backend java\n\nTop Skills Details:\n\nJava,Microservices,Api\n\nAdditional Skills & Qualifications:\n\nAirbnb used to be built on RoR. About 6 years ago, they switched to service oriented architecture and now are more focused on microservices.\n\nThis team stills owns several product that are on RoR. They are looking to migrate their applications over to new java. A lot of the services that they are trying to migrate are old and don't have great documentation.\n\nThis person will integrate with the team, operating as a contributing engineer on the team. There are two backend services that need to be created and five queues that need to be moved over.
